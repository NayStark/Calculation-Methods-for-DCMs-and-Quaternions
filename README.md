# Calculation-Methods-for-DCMs-and-Quaternions
The purpose of this project was to analyze and convert given sensor data to understand the nature of the data and the propagated error across different methods of calculation for DCMs and quaternions.
- This was a homework assignment in my "AERSP 450" class, where we learned about attitude acquisition and control methods. This project was very important in developing my understanding of different methods of calculation for attitude data.
